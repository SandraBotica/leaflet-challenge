<Leaflet_challenge.ipynb>

Dataset created by The United States Geological Survey, or USGS.
https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson

2.
A marker was created on the map for each earthquake latitude and longitude from the geojson URL.

The size of the marker is based on the magnitude of the earthquake i.e. earthquakes with higher magnitude appear larger.

The colour of the marker is based on the depth of the earthquake i.e. earthquakes with greater depth appear darker.

A legend for the depth of the earthquake has been added.

Each marker has a popup/tooltip with information about the location, magnitude and depth of the locations earthquake.

Enjoy marking this assignment!
